Install [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) for plugin management. Follow the instructions on the github page (except you don't need to add the sample .vimrc file, since the vimrc file in this repo already contains the necessary lines).

On a new machine, make sure to follow installation steps for [YouCompleteMe](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/youcompleteme) (or comment out the plugin)

For Tagbar and easytags, you need to have some version of ctags installed. You can run this command if it's not already installed: `sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags`
