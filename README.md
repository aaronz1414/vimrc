# Vundle
Install [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) for plugin management. Follow the instructions on the github page (except you don't need to add the sample .vimrc file, since the vimrc file in this repo already contains the necessary lines).

# YouCompleteMe
On a new machine, make sure to follow installation steps for [YouCompleteMe](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/youcompleteme) (or comment out the plugin)

# Tagbar and easytags
For [Tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar) and [easytags](https://github.com/xolox/vim-easytags/blob/master/INSTALL.md), you need to have some version of ctags installed. You can run this command if it's not already installed: `sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags`

# vim-go
[vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go) requires installing [go](https://golang.org/). You also need to run the command `:GoInstallBinaries` from within Vim once vim-go is installed in order to get things working
